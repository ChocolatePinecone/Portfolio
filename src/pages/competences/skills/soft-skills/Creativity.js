        <p>
            I love being creative. I&apos;ve had a wide variety of creative outlets in the past from painting miniatures,
            making music and poetry to making gadgets and developing games.

            I believe creativity is hugely important as it is the biggest part in problem-solving and is responsible for the greatest inventions.
            That&apos;s why I try to utilize and practice it both when working and when off-work.

            An example of my creativity is <ContentLink href='/experience/projects/rocket-shipment'>the PC videogame I&apos;m creating</ContentLink> from scratch.
            Feel free to check it out!
