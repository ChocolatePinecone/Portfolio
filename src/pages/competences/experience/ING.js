            <h1>Working for ING</h1>
            <p>
                While I worked for ING, they were combining the software platform of Belgium and the Netherlands. Next to this they are updating their website from an older technology (AngularJS) to a newer one (Polymer 2). <br/>
                <br/>
                Within ING, I've worked in a DevOps team where we worked in an Agile manner with room for T-shaped development.

            <h2>What was my job?</h2>
            <p>
                As Front-end developer I mainly worked on the <ContentLink href='/skills/hard-skills/frameworks/polymer'>Polymer</ContentLink> components for the new website. The components that we're building and maintaining have to be integrated into bigger applications, like the website and the mobile app. To do this, I've worked a lot with git and have communicated a lot with other teams.<br/>
                <br/>
                Now and then I've done some small changes in API configurations. These APIs were programmed in <ContentLink href='/skills/hard-skills/programming-languages/java'>Java</ContentLink>, set up with Maven and ran with Tomcat.<br/>
                <br/>
                My team frequently used Service-Now (which is like Trello/Jira), Git andÂ Jenkins. We worked as DevOps team to develop and maintain out applications.<br/>
                My team worked with a changing scrum master role. This means I've regularly acted as scrum master myself.<br/>
                <br/>
                Next to my normal work, I noticed there was unclarity about the OCD work (Operational Control Dashboard). This work involved the necessary evidence needed for security requirements of our applications.<br/>
                Because of this lack of knowledge, I've taken the initiative of learning more about it so I could give the team some guidance. Eventually because of this I became the point of contact for OCD within our team and I've organised some sessions to guide and work on the OCD.

            <h2>What was the result?</h2>
            <p>
                I've successfully created and maintained many components for ING. I've made the Agile way of working my own, and have been able to work in a T-shaped manner.
