        <h1>Working for ING</h1>
        <p>
            While I worked for ING, they were combining the software platform of Belgium and the Netherlands.
            Next to this they are updating their website from an older technology (AngularJS) to a newer one (Polymer 2).
        </p>
        <p>
            Within ING, I&apos;ve worked in a DevOps team where we worked in an Agile manner with room for T-shaped development.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>What was my job?</h2>
        <p>
            As Front-end developer I mainly worked on the <ContentLink href='/skills/hard-skills/frameworks/polymer'>Polymer</ContentLink> components for the new website.
            The components that we&apos;re building and maintaining have to be integrated into bigger applications, like the website and the mobile app.
            To do this, I&apos;ve worked a lot with git and have communicated a lot with other teams.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now and then I&apos;ve done some small changes in API configurations.
            These APIs were programmed in <ContentLink href='/skills/hard-skills/programming-languages/java'>Java</ContentLink>, set up with Maven and ran with Tomcat.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            My team frequently used Service-Now (which is like Trello/Jira), Git and Jenkins. We worked as DevOps team to develop and maintain our applications.
            <br />
            My team worked with a changing scrum master role. This means I&apos;ve regularly acted as scrum master myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next to my normal work, I noticed there was unclarity about the OCD work (Operational Control Dashboard).
            This work involved the necessary evidence needed for security requirements of our applications.
            <br />
            Because of this lack of knowledge, I&apos;ve taken the initiative of learning more about it so I could give the team some guidance.
            Eventually because of this I became the point of contact for OCD within our team and I&apos;ve organised some sessions to guide and work on the OCD.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>What was the result?</h2>
        <p>
            I&apos;ve successfully created and maintained many components for ING. I&apos;ve made the Agile way of working my own, and have been able to work in a T-shaped manner.
